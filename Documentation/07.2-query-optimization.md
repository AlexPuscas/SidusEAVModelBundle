## How to optimize the loading of your data

When querying your data using the API, you will only retrieve the Data entities without their associated Values, this is
actually a good thing and you should'nt try to join and select the values collection inside your queries because it
won't play well with any Pager in terms of performances.

The best way to optimize the loading of data in your app is to use the ````OptimizedDataLoader````:

````php
<?php
/**
 * @var \Sidus\EAVModelBundle\Doctrine\DataLoaderInterface $dataLoader
 * @var \Sidus\EAVModelBundle\Entity\DataInterface $book
 * @var \Sidus\EAVModelBundle\Entity\DataInterface[] $books
 */

$dataLoader->loadSingle($book);
$dataLoader->load($books);
````

This will ensure that all the required data are loaded in the minimum number of queries. By default it will load the
current values of the entities and all the related embed entities.

If you need to load additional relations you can use the ````autoload```` option for your relational attributes:

````yaml
sidus_eav_model:
    families:
        Post:
            attributeAsLabel: title
            attributes:
                # (...)

                author:
                    type: data_selector # This type allows to select an other entity inside the EAV model
                    options:
                        autoload: true
                        allowed_families:
                            - Author
````

The second parameter of both loading method can be used to tweak the depth at which data will be fetched, you can 
increase the default value to allow the loader to fetch additional relations in your data tree.

````php
<?php
/**
 * @var \Sidus\EAVModelBundle\Doctrine\DataLoaderInterface $dataLoader
 * @var \Sidus\EAVModelBundle\Entity\DataInterface $book
 * @var \Sidus\EAVModelBundle\Entity\DataInterface[] $books
 */

$dataLoader->loadSingle($book, 3);
$dataLoader->load($books, 2);
````
