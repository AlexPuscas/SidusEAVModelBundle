## Using a form

The default form to edit entities is referenced as 'Sidus\EAVModelBundle\Form\Type\DataType' and the only thing to keep
in mind is that it can't work without the "family" option.

### DataType forms
The DataType form and those who inherit from it (TabbedDataType) allows you to automatically generate
forms to manipulate entities inside the model.

````php
<?php
/** @var \Symfony\Component\Form\FormFactoryInterface $formFactory */
$form = $formFactory->create(\Sidus\EAVModelBundle\Form\Type\DataType::class, null, [
    'family' => 'Post',
]);
````

The only required option is the ````family```` used to defines the model to use to generate the form

#### Options references

##### family
Required in most cases, used to know how to generate the fields.
Can either be the family code or the family object.

##### empty_data
Defaults to the ````FamilyInterface::createData()```` method of the family.

##### attribute
Used in embed forms to reference to the attribute holding the embed DataType. In this case, if no ````family```` option
is passed, the form will check the ````allowed_families```` option of the attribute to get the family. This will work only
if there is only a single family in the ````allowed_families```` option.

##### attributes_config
This option is a little complicated and requires a whole chapter:
[DataType form configuration](05.2-form-configuration.md)
