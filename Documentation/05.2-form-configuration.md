### DataType form configuration

This chapter will cover the usage of the ````attributes_config```` options in the DataType forms.

The default behavior of the Data form type is to take all the attributes present in the family and display a widget for
each one (except the one with the ````hidden```` option).

You can completely "escape" this behavior by setting the ````attributes_config````, this allows you to configure each
attribute that will be used to generate the form.

You can also use the ````merge_attributes_config```` option if you want to keep the default attributes config and just
override some of them.

So for each attribute in the family, the configuration reference is the following: (in yml for the example)

````yml
attributes_config:
    <attributeCode>:
        # Defaults to the __toString of the attribute, see translation chapter for more information
        label: <string>
        
        # Defaults to the form_type of the attribute
        form_type: <string>
        
        # Defaults to the hidden option of the attribute
        hidden: <bool>
        
        # Defaults to [], will be merged by default with the attribute form_options
        form_options: <array>
        
        # Defaults to true: if set to false the form_options of the attribute will be ignored
        merge_form_options: <bool>
        
        # Default to attribute option, careful with this one!
        multiple: <bool>
        
        # Add new constraints to the generated form, default one will still be used!
        validation_rules: <array>
        
        # Default form type to use with collections
        collection_type: <string>
````

This configuration can be used in many ways to override the generation of the forms.
Extending this behaviour can be done by extending the AttributeFormBuilder that holds all the logic.

#### Switching from a ````data_selector```` type to an ````embed```` type
It's possible to switch from one type to the other with the attributes_config.

Example: data_selector to embed

````yml
sidus_eav_model:
    families:
        People:
            attributeAsIdentifier: email
            attributeAsLabel: fullName
            attributes:
                email:
                    type: string_identifier
                    validation_rules:
                        - Email:
                            strict: false
                fullName:
                    type: string
                organization:
                    type: data_selector
                    options:
                        allowed_families:
                            - Organization

````

Custom configuration:

````php
<?php
/** @var \Symfony\Component\Form\FormFactoryInterface $formFactory */
$form = $formFactory->create(\Sidus\EAVModelBundle\Form\Type\DataType::class, null, [
    'family' => 'People',
    'attributes_config' => [
        'email' => null, // Will use the default configuration if left null
        'fullName' => null,
        'organization' => [
            'form_type' => \Sidus\EAVModelBundle\Form\Type\DataType::class,
            'form_options' => [
                'family' => 'Organization',
            ],
            'validation_rules' => [
                new \Symfony\Component\Validator\Constraints\Valid(),
            ],
        ],
    ],
]);
````

Let's see what's changed:
- The form_type is required because it's necessary to change the widget of the form from a selector to an embed form.
- The form_options needs the ````family```` parameters because it's not injected by default.
- The validation rule is needed because by default the related entity in a simple data_selector is not validated by the
parent form.
